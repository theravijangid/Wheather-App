# Wheather-App
The Weather-App is a simple and user-friendly web application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With this app, you can quickly access weather information for your current location or any other city or country you desire.

Key Features:
1) Location Detection: Upon opening the Weather App, it will prompt you to grant access to your location. Once permission is given, the app will automatically detect your current location and display the weather information for that area.

2) Weather Information: The app provides detailed weather information for the detected location, including the current temperature, weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy), and a brief description of the weather.

3) Additional Weather Data: The Weather-App goes beyond basic weather details. It offers additional functions to provide you with more insights into the weather, such as the current wind speed, humidity level, and presence of haze or clouds.

4) Search Functionality: For those who want to check the weather of other places, the app includes a search tab. You can enter the name of a city or a country, and the app will fetch and display the weather information for that specific location.

This Weather App is designed to be visually appealing and easy to use. It serves as an excellent example of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be integrated to create a practical and enjoyable web application for accessing weather forecasts.

Feel free to explore the code and make any improvements or customizations as needed. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this project can be an exciting learning opportunity and a useful addition to your GitHub portfolio.
